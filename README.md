1. Spidering

    Crawling the Application: ZAP starts by "spidering" the target web application. This involves automatically browsing the website to discover all accessible pages and endpoints.
    Identify Links and Forms: It follows links, analyzes forms, and captures all endpoints and resources (like JavaScript files, CSS files, images, etc.).

3. Passive Scanning

    Analyze Traffic: While spidering and later during other interactions, ZAP performs passive scanning.
    Non-Intrusive Checks: Passive scanning involves non-intrusive checks, such as examining HTTP headers, cookies, and responses for common security issues (e.g., missing security headers, secure flag on cookies).
    Capture Findings: Any findings during passive scanning are logged without altering the traffic or the application.

4. Active Scanning

    Identify Vulnerabilities: ZAP then performs an active scan, where it actively probes the application to identify vulnerabilities.
    Inject Payloads: It sends crafted requests to the application to test for various types of vulnerabilities like SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), and more.
    Analyze Responses: The tool analyzes the application's responses to these injected payloads to determine if it is vulnerable.

6. Automated Attacks

    Quick Attack: ZAP can perform automated attacks like SQL Injection and XSS using pre-configured rules and payloads.
    Fuzzing: It also includes a fuzzer to test input fields with a variety of data to find buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities, and other input handling flaws.

7. Authentication and Session Management Testing

    Login Mechanisms: ZAP can be configured to test applications that require authentication. You can set up scripts to log in and maintain sessions.
    Session Management: It tests for weaknesses in session management mechanisms, such as session fixation, insufficient session expiration, and others.

8. Reporting

    Generate Reports: After the scan, ZAP generates detailed reports that include all the vulnerabilities found, their severity, and suggested remediation steps.
    Export Options: Reports can be exported in various formats (HTML, XML, JSON) for further analysis or sharing with development and security teams.

9. Manual Testing

    Interactive Tools: ZAP also provides tools for manual testing, such as intercepting proxy, request editor, and scripting support for custom tests.
    Analyze and Modify Requests: Security testers can manually analyze and modify HTTP requests and responses to test specific scenarios or validate automated findings.
